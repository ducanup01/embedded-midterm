# Smart IoT System for Monitoring Environment at an Office

### 📘 Course Information
**Course:** Embedded System  
**Professor:** Le Trong Nhan  
**Team Members:** Austin, Duke, Yen  

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Smart IoT System** that monitors environmental conditions in an office using **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** principles.  
The system collects sensor data, processes it in real time, and transmits it to a monitoring interface for visualization and analysis.
